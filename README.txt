== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= How often is the list of services updated? =

Constantly... and it's done automatically, without having to upgrade the plugin!

= How can I force the button to appear in individual posts and pages? =

If your button isn't already set up to appear (it is by default), type the following tag into the page or post that you want the button to appear in: `<!--sharesave-->`

= How can I remove a button from individual posts and pages? =

Type the following tag into the page or post that you do not want the button to appear in: `<!--nosharesave-->`

= Why do embedded objects (like Flash) disappear when hovering over the button? =

This is done to overcome browser limitations that prevent the drop-down menu from displaying on top of embedded objects.  If you would like to disable this, uncheck the `Hide embedded objects (Flash, video, etc.) when the menu is displayed ` option on the plugin's settings page.
